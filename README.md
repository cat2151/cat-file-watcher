## Overview

This is a file monitoring tool that watches for changes in file timestamps and executes commands when files are updated.

## Features

- Monitors multiple files simultaneously
- Executes custom commands on file changes
- Configurable via TOML configuration file
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-file-watcher.git
cd cat-file-watcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the file watcher by specifying a configuration file:

```bash
python -m src --config-filename config.toml
```

Arguments:
- `--config-filename`: Path to the TOML configuration file (required)

## Configuration

Create a TOML configuration file that defines the files to monitor and the commands to execute:

```toml
# Default monitoring interval
# Time format: "1s" (1 second), "2m" (2 minutes), "3h" (3 hours), "0.5s" (0.5 seconds)
default_interval = "1s"

# Configuration file self-check interval
config_check_interval = "1s"

# Command execution log file path (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Error log file path (optional)
# error_log_file = "error.log"

# Suppression log file path (optional)
# suppression_log_file = "suppression.log"

# Time period definitions (optional)
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }

[files]
"myfile.txt" = { command = "echo 'File changed!'" }
"script.py" = { command = "python -m pytest tests/", interval = "2s" }
"src/main.py" = { command = "make build", suppress_if_process = "vim|emacs|code" }
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process.sh", time_period = "night_shift" }
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
"lib/module.c" = { command = "gcc -c module.c -o module.o", cwd = "./lib" }
```

### Configuration Format

The configuration file requires a `[files]` section where each entry maps a filename to a command:

- **Key**: The path to the file or directory to monitor (relative or absolute path)
  - For files: Executes the command when the file's modification timestamp changes
  - For directories: Executes the command when the directory's modification timestamp changes (e.g., adding or deleting files)
- **Value**: An object with a `command` field containing the shell command to execute
  - `command` (required): The shell command to execute when the file or directory changes
  - `interval` (optional): The monitoring interval for this specific file or directory. Specified in time format ("1s", "2m", "3h", "0.5s"). Decimal values are also supported (e.g., "0.5s" for 0.5 seconds). If omitted, `default_interval` will be used.
  - `suppress_if_process` (optional): A regular expression pattern to match against running process names. If a matching process is found, command execution will be skipped. This is useful for preventing actions from being triggered while specific programs like editors are running.
  - `time_period` (optional): The name of a time period during which the file or directory should be monitored. Specify a time period name defined in the `[time_periods]` section. Monitoring will only occur within the specified time period.
  - `enable_log` (optional): When set to `true`, detailed command execution information will be logged to a file (default: `false`). The `log_file` setting must be configured in the global settings.
  - `cwd` (optional): Changes the working directory to the specified path before executing the command. This ensures that relative paths within the command are resolved from the specified directory.

### Global Settings

- `default_interval` (optional): The default monitoring interval for all files and directories. Specified in time format ("1s", "2m", "3h", "0.5s"). Decimal values are also supported (e.g., "0.5s" for 0.5 seconds). If omitted, "1s" (1 second) will be used.
- `config_check_interval` (optional): The interval for checking changes to the configuration file itself. Specified in time format ("1s", "2m", "3h", "0.5s"). If the configuration file changes, it will be automatically reloaded. If omitted, "1s" (1 second) will be used.
- `log_file` (optional): The path to the log file where detailed command execution information will be recorded. If set, command execution details (timestamp, path, TOML configuration content) for files or directories with `enable_log = true` will be recorded in this file.
- `error_log_file` (optional): The path to the error log file where detailed command execution errors will be recorded. If set, detailed information such as error messages, executed commands, standard error output, and stack traces on command failures will be recorded in this file.
- `suppression_log_file` (optional): The path to the log file where details of command execution suppression will be recorded. If set, information (timestamp, file path, process pattern, matched process) when command execution is skipped due to `suppress_if_process` will be recorded in this file.

### Time Period Settings

You can define time periods in the `[time_periods]` section (optional):

- Each time period is defined with a name.
- `start`: Start time (HH:MM format, e.g., "09:00")
- `end`: End time (HH:MM format, e.g., "17:00")
- Time periods spanning across midnight are also supported (e.g., `start = "23:00", end = "01:00"`).
- If you specify a time period name using the `time_period` parameter for each file, that file or directory will only be monitored within that time period.

Example:
```toml
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }  # Regular business hours
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }     # Time period spanning across midnight
```

### Configuration Example

Refer to `examples/config.example.toml` for a complete example of various use cases.

```toml
# Set default monitoring interval to 1 second
default_interval = "1s"

# Set configuration file self-check interval to 1 second
config_check_interval = "1s"

# Log file for detailed command execution (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Error log file (optional)
# error_log_file = "error.log"

# Command suppression log file (optional)
# suppression_log_file = "suppression.log"

# Time period definitions
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
after_hours = { start = "18:00", end = "08:00" }  # Spanning across midnight

[files]
# Use default interval (check every 1 second)
"document.txt" = { command = "cp document.txt document.txt.bak" }

# Specify custom interval (check every 0.5 seconds)
"app.log" = { command = "notify-send 'Log Updated' 'New entries in app.log'", interval = "0.5s" }

# Specify custom interval (check every 5 seconds)
"config.ini" = { command = "systemctl reload myapp", interval = "5s" }

# Monitor only during business hours
"report.txt" = { command = "python generate_report.py", time_period = "business_hours" }

# Monitor only outside business hours (e.g., batch processing)
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process_batch.sh", time_period = "after_hours" }

# Enable logging for important files (records timestamp, file path, and configuration content)
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

## How It Works

1. The tool reads the TOML configuration file.
2. It monitors the modification timestamps of all specified files.
3. When a file's timestamp changes, the associated command is executed.
4. It also monitors the configuration file itself and automatically reloads it if changes are detected.
5. This process continuously repeats until stopped with Ctrl+C.

### Command Execution Processing

**Important**: Commands are executed **sequentially**.

- When a file change is detected and a command is executed, the next file check does not occur until the command completes (or times out after 30 seconds).
- For example, if a file's command takes 25 seconds to complete, monitoring of other files will be paused during those 25 seconds.
- If other files are updated during this time, they will not be detected until after the running command completes (they will be detected in the next main loop iteration).
- The current implementation does not support parallel monitoring and execution of multiple files.

If you need long-running commands, consider using background execution within the command, or launching it as a separate process.

**Non-blocking execution methods**:
- **Linux/macOS**: Append `&` at the end of the command (e.g., `command = "long_task.sh &"`)
- **Windows**: Prepend `start ` at the beginning of the command (e.g., `command = "start long_task.bat"`)

### Command Execution Output

The standard output and standard error of executed commands are displayed on the console **in real-time**:

- **Output Display**: The standard output and standard error of commands are progressively displayed on the console during execution. Even for long-running commands, you can observe the progress in real-time.
- **On Failure**: If a command fails (exit code other than 0), a message like `Error: Command failed for '<file path>' with exit code <code_value>` will be displayed.
- **Error Log File**: If `error_log_file` is configured, error messages and executed commands on command failures will be recorded in the log file.

Command execution timeout is set to 30 seconds; if exceeded, a timeout error will occur.
