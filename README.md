## Overview

This is a file monitoring tool that watches for changes in file timestamps and executes a command when a file is updated.

## Features

- Monitor multiple files simultaneously
- Execute custom commands on file changes
- Configurable via TOML configuration file
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-file-watcher.git
cd cat-file-watcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the file watcher by specifying a configuration file:

```bash
python -m src --config-filename config.toml
```

Arguments:
- `--config-filename`: Path to the TOML configuration file (required)

## Configuration

Create a TOML configuration file to define the files to monitor and the commands to execute:

```toml
# Default monitoring interval (in milliseconds)
default_interval = 1000

# Configuration file self-check interval (in milliseconds)
config_check_interval = 1000

# File path for command execution logs (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Time period definitions (optional)
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }

[files]
"myfile.txt" = { command = "echo 'File changed!'" }
"script.py" = { command = "python -m pytest tests/", interval = 2000 }
"src/main.py" = { command = "make build", suppress_if_process = "vim|emacs|code" }
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process.sh", time_period = "night_shift" }
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
"lib/module.c" = { command = "gcc -c module.c -o module.o", cwd = "./lib" }
```

### Configuration Format

The configuration file requires a `[files]` section, where each entry maps a file name to a command:

- **Key**: The path to the file or directory to monitor (relative or absolute path)
  - For files: The command is executed when the file's modification time changes.
  - For directories: The command is executed when the directory's modification time changes (e.g., when files are added or deleted).
- **Value**: An object with a `command` field containing the shell command to execute.
  - `command` (required): The shell command to execute when the file or directory changes.
  - `interval` (optional): The monitoring interval for this file or directory (in milliseconds). If omitted, `default_interval` will be used.
  - `suppress_if_process` (optional): A regular expression pattern that matches running process names. If a matching process is found, the command execution is skipped. This is useful for preventing actions from triggering when specific programs like editors are running.
  - `time_period` (optional): The name of the time period during which the file or directory should be monitored. Specify a time period name defined in the `[time_periods]` section. Monitoring will only occur within the specified time period.
  - `enable_log` (optional): If set to `true`, detailed command execution information will be recorded in the log file (default: `false`). The `log_file` setting is required in the global configuration.
  - `cwd` (optional): Changes the working directory to the specified path before executing the command. This ensures that relative paths within the command are resolved from the specified directory.

### Global Configuration

- `default_interval` (optional): The default monitoring interval for all files and directories (in milliseconds). If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) will be used.
- `config_check_interval` (optional): The interval for checking changes to the configuration file itself (in milliseconds). If the configuration file changes, it will be automatically reloaded. If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) will be used.
- `log_file` (optional): The path to the log file for recording detailed command execution information. If set, command execution details (timestamp, path, TOML configuration content) for files or directories with `enable_log = true` will be recorded in this file.

### Time Period Configuration

You can define time periods in the `[time_periods]` section (optional):

- Each time period is defined with a name.
- `start`: Start time (HH:MM format, e.g., "09:00").
- `end`: End time (HH:MM format, e.g., "17:00").
- Time periods spanning across midnight are also supported (e.g., `start = "23:00", end = "01:00"`).
- By specifying a time period name using the `time_period` parameter for each file, that file or directory will only be monitored within that time period.

Example:
```toml
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }  # Normal business hours
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }     # Time period spanning across midnight
```

### Configuration Example

Refer to `examples/config.example.toml` for a complete example of various use cases.

```toml
# Set default monitoring interval to 1 second
default_interval = 1000

# Set configuration file self-check interval to 1 second
config_check_interval = 1000

# Log file for detailed command execution (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Time period definitions
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
after_hours = { start = "18:00", end = "08:00" }  # Spans across midnight

[files]
# Use default interval (checks every 1 second)
"document.txt" = { command = "cp document.txt document.txt.bak" }

# Specify custom interval (checks every 500ms)
"app.log" = { command = "notify-send 'Log Updated' 'New entries in app.log'", interval = 500 }

# Specify custom interval (checks every 5 seconds)
"config.ini" = { command = "systemctl reload myapp", interval = 5000 }

# Monitor only during business hours
"report.txt" = { command = "python generate_report.py", time_period = "business_hours" }

# Monitor only outside business hours (e.g., for batch processing)
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process_batch.sh", time_period = "after_hours" }

# Enable logging for important files (records timestamp, file path, and configuration details)
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

## How it Works

1. The tool loads the TOML configuration file.
2. It monitors the modification timestamps of all specified files.
3. When a file's timestamp changes, the associated command is executed.
4. The configuration file itself is also monitored, and if it changes, it is automatically reloaded.
5. This process continuously repeats until stopped by Ctrl+C.

## Concept

Prioritizes simple and maintainable TOML configuration.

## Usage Scenarios

- If you want to easily monitor file updates and operate it with ease, use cat-file-watcher.
- If you want to quickly toggle monitoring on/off for scattered files, use cat-file-watcher.
- If you want to utilize the unique features available only in this tool, use cat-file-watcher.
- For more advanced features, consider other applications.
- For TypeScript application development, a standard task runner is typically used.
