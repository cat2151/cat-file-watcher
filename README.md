## Overview

This is a file monitoring tool that watches for changes in file timestamps and executes commands when files are updated.

## Features

- Monitor multiple files simultaneously
- Execute custom commands on file changes
- Configurable via TOML configuration file
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-file-watcher.git
cd cat-file-watcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the file watcher by specifying a configuration file:

```bash
python -m src --config-filename config.toml
```

Arguments:
- `--config-filename`: Path to the TOML configuration file (required)

## Configuration

Create a TOML configuration file that defines the files to monitor and the commands to execute:

```toml
# Default monitoring interval (in milliseconds)
default_interval = 1000

# Interval for checking changes to the configuration file itself (in milliseconds)
config_check_interval = 1000

# File path for command execution logs (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Time period definitions (optional)
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }

[files]
"myfile.txt" = { command = "echo 'File changed!'" }
"script.py" = { command = "python -m pytest tests/", interval = 2000 }
"src/main.py" = { command = "make build", suppress_if_process = "vim|emacs|code" }
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process.sh", time_period = "night_shift" }
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

### Configuration Format

The configuration file requires a `[files]` section where each entry maps a filename to a command:

- **Key**: Path to the file or directory to monitor (relative or absolute)
  - For files: Command executes when the file's modification time changes
  - For directories: Command executes when the directory's modification time changes (e.g., when files are added or removed)
- **Value**: An object containing a `command` field with the shell command to execute
  - `command` (required): The shell command to execute when the file or directory changes
  - `interval` (optional): The monitoring interval for this file or directory (in milliseconds). If omitted, `default_interval` will be used.
  - `suppress_if_process` (optional): A regular expression pattern to match against running process names. If a matching process is found, command execution will be skipped. This is useful for preventing actions from being triggered when certain programs, such as editors, are running.
  - `time_period` (optional): The name of a time period during which to monitor the file or directory. Specify a time period name defined in the `[time_periods]` section. Monitoring will only occur within the specified time period.
  - `enable_log` (optional): If set to `true`, detailed command execution information will be logged to a log file (default: `false`). The `log_file` must be configured in the global settings.

### Global Settings

- `default_interval` (optional): The default monitoring interval for all files and directories (in milliseconds). If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) will be used.
- `config_check_interval` (optional): The interval for checking changes to the configuration file itself (in milliseconds). If the configuration file is modified, it will be automatically reloaded. If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) will be used.
- `log_file` (optional): The path to the log file where detailed command execution information will be recorded. If configured, command execution information (timestamp, path, TOML configuration content) for files or directories with `enable_log = true` will be logged to this file.

### Time Period Settings

You can define time periods in the `[time_periods]` section (optional):

- Each time period is defined with a name.
- `start`: Start time (HH:MM format, e.g., "09:00")
- `end`: End time (HH:MM format, e.g., "17:00")
- Time periods spanning across midnight are also supported (e.g., `start = "23:00", end = "01:00"`).
- By specifying a time period name with the `time_period` parameter for each file or directory, that item will only be monitored within that specific time period.

Example:
```toml
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }  # Regular business hours
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }     # Time period spanning midnight
```

### Configuration Examples

For a complete example covering various use cases, refer to `examples/config.example.toml`.

```toml
# Set the default monitoring interval to 1 second
default_interval = 1000

# Set the configuration file self-check interval to 1 second
config_check_interval = 1000

# Log file for detailed command execution (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Define time periods
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
after_hours = { start = "18:00", end = "08:00" }  # Spans across midnight

[files]
# Use default interval (checks every 1 second)
"document.txt" = { command = "cp document.txt document.txt.bak" }

# Specify custom interval (checks every 500ms)
"app.log" = { command = "notify-send 'Log Updated' 'New entries in app.log'", interval = 500 }

# Specify custom interval (checks every 5 seconds)
"config.ini" = { command = "systemctl reload myapp", interval = 5000 }

# Monitor only during business hours
"report.txt" = { command = "python generate_report.py", time_period = "business_hours" }

# Monitor only during after hours (e.g., for batch processing)
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process_batch.sh", time_period = "after_hours" }

# Enable logging for an important file (logs timestamp, file path, and config details)
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

## How it Works

1. The tool reads the TOML configuration file.
2. It monitors the modification timestamps of all specified files.
3. When a file's timestamp changes, the associated command is executed.
4. It also monitors the configuration file itself and automatically reloads it if changes are detected.
5. This process continuously repeats until stopped with Ctrl+C.

## Concept

Prioritizes simple and maintainable TOML descriptions.

## Usage Scenarios

For easy file change monitoring and straightforward operation, use `cat-file-watcher`.
