## Overview

This is a file monitoring tool that watches for changes in file timestamps and executes commands when files are updated.

## Features

- Monitor multiple files simultaneously
- Execute custom commands on file changes
- Configurable via TOML settings file
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-file-watcher.git
cd cat-file-watcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the file watcher by specifying a configuration file:

```bash
python src/cat_file_watcher.py --config-filename config.toml
```

Arguments:
- `--config-filename`: Path to the TOML configuration file (required)

## Configuration

Create a TOML configuration file to define the files to monitor and the commands to execute:

```toml
# Default monitoring interval (in milliseconds)
default_interval = 1000

# Configuration file change check interval (in milliseconds)
config_check_interval = 1000

# File path for command execution logs (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Time period definitions (optional)
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }

[files]
"myfile.txt" = { command = "echo 'File changed!'" }
"script.py" = { command = "python -m pytest tests/", interval = 2000 }
"src/main.py" = { command = "make build", suppress_if_process = "vim|emacs|code" }
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process.sh", time_period = "night_shift" }
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

### Configuration Format

The configuration file requires a `[files]` section where each entry maps a filename to a command:

- **Key**: The path to the file to monitor (relative or absolute).
- **Value**: An object with a `command` field containing the shell command to execute.
  - `command` (required): The shell command to execute when the file changes.
  - `interval` (optional): The monitoring interval for this specific file (in milliseconds). If omitted, `default_interval` is used.
  - `suppress_if_process` (optional): A regular expression pattern that matches running process names. If a matching process is found, the command execution is skipped. This is useful for preventing actions from being triggered when specific programs like editors are running.
  - `time_period` (optional): The name of the time period during which the file should be monitored. Specifies a time period name defined in the `[time_periods]` section. The file will only be monitored within the specified time period.
  - `enable_log` (optional): Set to `true` to log detailed command execution to the log file (default: `false`). Requires `log_file` to be set in the global configuration.

### Global Settings

- `default_interval` (optional): The default monitoring interval for all files (in milliseconds). If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) is used.
- `config_check_interval` (optional): The interval (in milliseconds) for checking changes in the configuration file itself. If the configuration file changes, it will be automatically reloaded. If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) is used.
- `log_file` (optional): The path to a log file where detailed command execution information will be recorded. If set, command execution details (timestamp, file path, TOML configuration) for files with `enable_log = true` will be recorded in this file.

### Time Period Settings

You can define time periods in the `[time_periods]` section (optional):

- Each time period is defined with a name.
- `start`: Start time (HH:MM format, e.g., "09:00").
- `end`: End time (HH:MM format, e.g., "17:00").
- Supports time periods spanning across midnight (e.g., `start = "23:00", end = "01:00"`).
- If you specify a `time_period` parameter for a file, it will only be monitored during that defined time period.

Example:
```toml
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }  # Regular business hours
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }     # Time period spanning midnight
```

### Configuration Examples

Refer to `examples/config.example.toml` for complete examples of various use cases.

```toml
# Set default monitoring interval to 1 second
default_interval = 1000

# Set configuration file change check interval to 1 second
config_check_interval = 1000

# Log file for detailed command execution (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Define time periods
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
after_hours = { start = "18:00", end = "08:00" }  # Spans midnight

[files]
# Use default interval (checks every 1 second)
"document.txt" = { command = "cp document.txt document.txt.bak" }

# Specify custom interval (checks every 500ms)
"app.log" = { command = "notify-send 'Log Updated' 'New entries in app.log'", interval = 500 }

# Specify custom interval (checks every 5 seconds)
"config.ini" = { command = "systemctl reload myapp", interval = 5000 }

# Monitor only during business hours
"report.txt" = { command = "python generate_report.py", time_period = "business_hours" }

# Monitor only during after-hours (e.g., for batch processing)
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process_batch.sh", time_period = "after_hours" }

# Enable logging for important files (records timestamp, file path, and config details)
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

## How it Works

1. The tool reads the TOML configuration file.
2. It monitors the modification timestamps of all specified files.
3. When a file's timestamp changes, the associated command is executed.
4. The configuration file itself is also monitored and automatically reloaded if changed.
5. This process continuously repeats until stopped with Ctrl+C.

## Concept

Prioritizes simplicity and maintainability of TOML descriptions.

## Usage Distinction

For easy file change monitoring and effortless operation, use cat-file-watcher.

For more advanced features, consider other applications.
