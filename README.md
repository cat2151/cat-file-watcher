## Overview

This is a file monitoring tool that monitors changes to file timestamps and executes commands when files are updated.

## Features

- Monitor multiple files simultaneously
- Execute custom commands on file change
- Configurable via TOML configuration file
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-file-watcher.git
cd cat-file-watcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the file watcher with a specified configuration file:

```bash
python src/cat_file_watcher.py --config-filename config.toml
```

Arguments:
- `--config-filename`: Path to the TOML configuration file (required)

## Configuration

Create a TOML configuration file to define the files to monitor and the commands to execute:

```toml
# Default monitoring interval (in milliseconds)
default_interval = 1000

# Interval for checking changes to the config file itself (in milliseconds)
config_check_interval = 1000

# Log file path for command execution logging (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Time period definitions (optional)
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }

[files]
"myfile.txt" = { command = "echo 'File changed!'" }
"script.py" = { command = "python -m pytest tests/", interval = 2000 }
"src/main.py" = { command = "make build", suppress_if_process = "vim|emacs|code" }
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process.sh", time_period = "night_shift" }
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

### Configuration Format

The configuration file requires a `[files]` section where each entry maps a filename to a command:

- **Key**: Path to the file to monitor (relative or absolute)
- **Value**: An object with a `command` field containing the shell command to execute
  - `command` (required): The shell command to execute when the file changes
  - `interval` (optional): The monitoring interval for this file (in milliseconds). If omitted, `default_interval` will be used.
  - `suppress_if_process` (optional): A regular expression pattern to match against running process names. If a matching process is found, command execution will be skipped. This is useful for preventing actions from triggering when specific programs like editors are running.
  - `time_period` (optional): The name of a time period during which the file should be monitored. Specify a time period name defined in the `[time_periods]` section. The file will only be monitored within the specified time period.
  - `enable_log` (optional): Set to `true` to log command execution details to the log file (default: `false`). Requires `log_file` to be configured globally.

### Global Settings

- `default_interval` (optional): The default monitoring interval for all files (in milliseconds). If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) will be used.
- `config_check_interval` (optional): The interval for checking changes to the configuration file itself (in milliseconds). If the configuration file changes, it will be automatically reloaded. If omitted, 1000ms (1 second) will be used.
- `log_file` (optional): Path to the log file where command execution details will be recorded. When specified, files with `enable_log = true` will log their command execution information (timestamp, file path, and all TOML settings) to this file.

### Time Period Settings

You can define time periods in the `[time_periods]` section (optional):

- Each time period is defined with a name
- `start`: Start time (HH:MM format, e.g., "09:00")
- `end`: End time (HH:MM format, e.g., "17:00")
- Time periods spanning across midnight are also supported (e.g., `start = "23:00", end = "01:00"`)
- If you specify a time period name using the `time_period` parameter for each file, the file will only be monitored within that time period.

Example:
```toml
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }  # Normal business hours
night_shift = { start = "23:00", end = "01:00" }     # Time period spanning midnight
```

### Configuration Example

For a complete example covering various use cases, refer to `config.example.toml`.

```toml
# Set the default monitoring interval to 1 second
default_interval = 1000

# Set the configuration file self-check interval to 1 second
config_check_interval = 1000

# Log file for command execution details (optional)
log_file = "command_execution.log"

# Time period definitions
[time_periods]
business_hours = { start = "09:00", end = "17:00" }
after_hours = { start = "18:00", end = "08:00" }  # Spans across midnight

[files]
# Uses default interval (checks every 1 second)
"document.txt" = { command = "cp document.txt document.txt.bak" }

# Specifies a custom interval (checks every 500ms)
"app.log" = { command = "notify-send 'Log Updated' 'New entries in app.log'", interval = 500 }

# Specifies a custom interval (checks every 5 seconds)
"config.ini" = { command = "systemctl reload myapp", interval = 5000 }

# Monitored only during business hours
"report.txt" = { command = "python generate_report.py", time_period = "business_hours" }

# Monitored only outside business hours (e.g., for batch processing)
"batch.csv" = { command = "./process_batch.sh", time_period = "after_hours" }

# Enable logging for critical file (logs timestamp, file path, and settings)
"important.txt" = { command = "backup.sh", enable_log = true }
```

## How it Works

1. The tool reads the TOML configuration file.
2. It monitors the modification timestamps of all specified files.
3. When a file's timestamp changes, it executes the associated command.
4. It also monitors the configuration file itself and automatically reloads it if changes are detected.
5. This process continuously repeats until stopped with Ctrl+C.
