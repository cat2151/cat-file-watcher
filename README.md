## Overview

This is a file monitoring tool that watches for changes in file timestamps and executes commands when files are updated.

## Features

- Monitor multiple files simultaneously
- Execute custom commands on file changes
- Configurable via TOML configuration file
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-file-watcher.git
cd cat-file-watcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the file watcher by specifying a configuration file:

```bash
python src/cat_file_watcher.py --config-filename config.toml
```

Arguments:
- `--config-filename`: Path to the TOML configuration file (required)

## Configuration

Create a TOML configuration file to define the files to monitor and the commands to execute:

```toml
[files]
"myfile.txt" = { command = "echo 'File changed!'" }
"script.py" = { command = "python -m pytest tests/" }
```

### Configuration Format

The configuration file requires a `[files]` section where each entry maps a filename to a command:

- **Key**: The path to the file to monitor (relative or absolute)
- **Value**: An object with a `command` field containing the shell command to execute

### Configuration Example

Refer to `config.example.toml` for a complete example with various use cases.

```toml
[files]
"document.txt" = { command = "cp document.txt document.txt.bak" }
"app.log" = { command = "notify-send 'Log Updated' 'New entries in app.log'" }
```

## How It Works

1. The tool loads the TOML configuration file.
2. It monitors the modification timestamps of all specified files.
3. When a file's timestamp changes, the associated command is executed.
4. This process continuously repeats until stopped by Ctrl+C.
